The planet of Flindall lies approximately 149.6 million km from its star. The creatures that inhabit it are rather peculiar, but its climate is temperate, and its resources plenty. Its inhabitants are part of a very balanced and therefore very fragile ecosystem, so contact with the planet has not yet been made. We are thus far unsure whether our presence on the planet will have any negative consequences.
